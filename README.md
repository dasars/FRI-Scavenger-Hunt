# FRI-Scavenger-Hunt
We extended and improved on an existing project called Scavenger Hunt, which looked at different search algorithms and measured how effecient they would be for an embodied agent to find randomly placed objects in an abstract simulation. This problem aims to tackle the question of object retrieval in dynamic search spaces.The embodied agent knows probabilities of what locations could have objects and then is timed to see how quickly it can find all objects. Our group improved upon existing research by making a "Timed Bayesian Agent" which is based on the Exhaustive Bayesian Search. We created an algorithm that does a breadth-first search through the locations with a time limit for different possibilities of object locations.
